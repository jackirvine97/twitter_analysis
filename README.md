# twitter_analysis
Playground for interacting with the Twitter API.

## Installation

These scripts are best run in a conda virtual environment. Note, `wordcloud` is currently incompatible with Python 3.9 on conda forge, so it is recommended that these scripts are executed in a virutal environment running Python 3.8:

```
conda create --name env-name python=3.8
```
