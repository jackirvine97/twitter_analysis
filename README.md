# twitter_analysis
Playground for interacting with the Twitter API.

## Context

This repository hosts scripts for querying the Twitter API and text analysis of tweets. At present it is in an exploratory phase of development and as such it is a collection of sample scripts. As use cases are refined this may evolve.

## Installation

These scripts are best run in a conda virtual environment (conda best installed via [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)):

```
conda create --name env_name
```

To activate your environment run:

```
conda activate env_name
```

Finally install the requirements for querying Twitter:

```
conda install --yes --file --requirements.txt
```
